The advertising platform automatically adjusts the bids based on the frequency of ad impressions and clicks, optimizing them to result in an average cost. This strategy provides advertisers with more control and allows them to manage their budget more effectively.\n\n**Maximum Bidding:** In this strategy, the advertiser sets a maximum bid for each click.
